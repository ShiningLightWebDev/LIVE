	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<p class="intro">
		The Limited is the leading employer of women professionals 
		in the Columbus area, and I was pleased to join their 
		e-commerce team as a front end web developer. I updated the 
		site three to four times a week to include new banners, 
		images, and other content for upcoming sales. I also expanded 
		functionality of the order history section, and assisted in 
		styling the new look for the website.

			<p>This was the design of the site when I first started. 
			Main banner images rotated and changed on hover. All links 
			required google analytics codes. Also, text and styling 
			needed to updated for the rotating banner at the top of 
			the page.</p>

			<p>During my time with The Limited, I expanded the functionality 
			of the existing order history section. I added links to the items 
			so that users could repurchase if desired. I also added the ability 
			to see an order that had not yet been sent to the fulfiller.</p>
			<p>I assisted in the addition of "Reserve Online. Pickup in Store." 
			for the e-commerce department. I also updated Google Maps and The 
			Limited's online maps to include new stores. I tested and updated 
			email templates as needed.</p>
