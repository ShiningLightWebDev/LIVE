				<p>Currently I am working full-time as a front end developer

				environment here is really amazing, and I am learning a lot.

				I have a lot more experience now with Bootstrap and with JQuery. 
				I have also had the opportunity to learn quite a bit about using 
				MVC through projects utilizing .NET and Laravel.</p>
