	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p class="intro">
	At 2checkout.com, I worked on modifying and designing Wordpress themes using 
	PHP and CSS. I edited an existing master CSS file using SASS, weaning out 
	deprecated
	code and adhering to coding standards. I used Git as a source control tool, and 
	Version One to track project progress.
