	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p class="intro">
	I worked for Crown Partners as an outside consultant, through a recruitment 
	company based in Columbus, Ohio. I was hired to help a client move their website 
	to Adobe CQ5. I worked 
	as a part of a small development team. My tasks consisted of editing 
	and augmenting the existing CSS code, as well as some widget enhancement.
