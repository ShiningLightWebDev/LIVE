	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p class="intro">
	At Deviation Point Media, I worked as a part-time consultant. I used PHP
	and MS-SQL to revamp a BTO workflow application. I used HTML, CSS, and PHP
	to rewrite the website during a switch in hosting providers, to add
	responsive design elements, and to conform to industry standards. This
	website is representative of my accessible, mobile-friendly, minimalist
	style.
