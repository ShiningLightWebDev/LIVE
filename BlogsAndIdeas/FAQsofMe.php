	<h2>Questions I Am Frequently Asked During an Interview</h2>
	
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		Why don't you tell me a little about yourself?
		</p>
		<!-- <p class="answer">
		I really hate this question, and will avoid answering it directly if I
		can. First, it is a vague question. The sheer ambiguity of this 
		question makes it difficult for me to communicate. I can not think
		of a goal this question meets that could not be better met by asking a
		different question. What are you really asking about?
		Are you asking about my hobbies? Would you like to know about my family
		life? That's really none of your business, and could open your company
		up to potential lawsuits. (Please see my post on <a href="neveraskthis.php">
		why I would never ever ask a job candidate about his family life</a>.) 
		Would you like to know about my development experience? Would you like
		to know where I grew up and what school I graduated from? What are you 
		looking for?
		</p>	-->
		<p class="answer">
		Most of the time, I will counter this question with
		the question "Where would you like me to start?" If I am then asked
		"Just tell me what you think I should know about yourself", 
		I will describe my hobbies. I do enjoy scrapbooking, playing saga video 
		games,
		watching action movies (anything with Bruce Willis rocks my world), and
		cooking frozen food because I am a disaster in the kitchen. I'm also a
		bit of a grammar freak, but that doesn't usually come up at work very
		often.

	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		How many years of web design experience do you have?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		The short answer is none. The longer (and more polite) answer is that
		I have no experience with web design, but 20 years of experience with
		web development. This is an important distinction to make because these
		two roles carry different expectations. <!--(Please see my post
		about <a href="webdesvswebdev.php">the difference between web design
		and web development</a> for further clarification.) -->Defining
		expectations and my experience is useful in determining whether I will
		meet the current needs. Answering this question early in the interview
		can be an excellent way to determine whether to continue the interview.

	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		How did you get started in web development?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I got started in 1995 when my technology instructor and literature
		instructor came up with a joint assignment. Students were to select,
		read, and review a book from a list compiled by the instructors. There
		was a catch, however: the review had to be presented via webpage. We
		were encouraged to use the free web-hosting service offered by
		GeoCities. Once I began building my report site, I discovered that I
		did not like the WYSIWYG page creator, and decided to learn enough HTML
		and JavaScript to create my own webpage. I enjoyed my experience
		learning and creating very much, and went on to build custom pages for
		several of my friends who were taking the same classes. From there I 
		worked sporadically, getting contracts by word of mouth, while I 
		studied international languages with hopes to be a translator.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		Why did you continue with web development? How did you expand your
		skills?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		Basically, it was fun to build webpages. I enjoyed checking books on
		HTML and JavaScript out of the library. I was learning something fun
		and useful, and it made me feel good about myself. I maintained my own
		webpage and those of four friends for three years. In late 1999, I was
		introduced to the concepts of CSS. This opened a whole new world of
		possibilities, and I enjoyed fiddling with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
		on personal projects and simple websites for my church, youth group,
		PTA fundraiser, and other such programs.

	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		What is your favorite of all your projects?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		The answer to this one is fairly simple, but can seem like a cop-out.
		Essentially, my favorite project is the one I'm working on at the time.
		For each project that I have completed, I have learned a little more
		about the technologies I'm using. I have made new contacts. I have
		grown as a developer and as a person. I enjoy different environments 
		and different work styles. I have been part of small teams and large 
		teams. I'm always disappointed when a project ends, but I'm always 
		excited about the next one.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		If you had to choose one project that is best representative of your
		capabilities, which would it be?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">		
		Is it okay if I narrow this down to two projects? I would choose 
		my work with the South Carolina Assistive Technology Program (SCATP),
		and my time with Insurance Intermediaries, Inc. (III). The reason that 
		the SCATP project is best representative of my abilities is that it 
		showcases my self-direction
		and drive. When I started that project, I knew nothing about PHP or
		SQL, but was able to build a functional product that met the needs of
		the client. The reason the III project is best representative of my
		abilities is that it showcases my ability to work directly with the
		client and with other team members to build a quality product that
		exceeded expectations.
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		The actual tasks for the SCATP and for III were remarkably similar. In
		these two projects, I worked with program directors to establish
		project needs, requirements, and nice-to-haves. I drew up scope
		documents, and created a proposal to meet the defined needs and
		requirements. Once my proposal was accepted, I built the product,
		tested it, deployed it, trained users, and performed troubleshooting
		and error-correction activities. For SCATP, the users and program
		director did not provide much input beyond the project definition phase.
		I worked with one other developer, who tested my work and taught me new
		techniques. For III, the users provided consistent feedback. I worked
		with a small IT team who supported my work and provided necessary data
		and security access.
