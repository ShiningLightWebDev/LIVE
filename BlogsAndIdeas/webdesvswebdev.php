	<h2>What is the difference between "web design"
	and "web development"? Do the terms even matter?</h2>

	<p>I am frequently asked how much experience with web design I have, or
	what kind of web design I do. This is a really great opportunity to teach
	the asker a bit more about the Internet than they currently know.</p>
	<p>Most people know that the web is built of "pages". What they may not
	realize is that each page is made up of many different files. There are
	files for images, text, and sound; files for how to make these elements 
	appear in the right place and as the right color; and files for how to make
	these elements act the right way. There are many other kinds of files that
	could make up a single web page, but these are the basics.</p>
	<p>In order to have all these files, someone has to create them. This is
	where web designers and web developers get their jobs. The most basic way
	that I can describe the difference is that web designers create the way
	the webpage looks (also called UI design) and the way it flows (also called
	UX design). Web developers make the web page exist. If I
	may offer an analogy: websites can be like houses. A web designer will draw
	the blueprints -- a web developer will do the construction. A web designer
	will decide on paint colors and create the artwork for the walls -- a web
	developer paints the walls and hangs the photos. A web designer picks lush
	carpet or hardwood floors -- a web developer makes sure there is a floor to
	put the carpet or hardwood on.</p>
	<p>There are some things that both web designers and web developers can do.
	As a developer, I often help choose the paint color, or the floor
	coverings. I also help with deciding where doors and windows should go, and
	whether they should open outwardly or inwardly, as well as ensuring that
	they work once they're hung.
	Occasionally a web designer will give me the pre-fabricated pieces of a
	house. The walls are painted, the floors are covered, the windows and doors
	are hung. I just have to cut apart the pieces, glue them into the right
	places, and then make sure the walls don't move and that the windows and
	doors lead to where you want them to go.</p>
	<p>To leave the analogy, web designers build the image files and plan the
	layout of a webpage. Almost the only thing I can't do, that web designers
	do, is to create the image files and sound files that will be used on the
	website. The thing that I can do, that most designers can't, is to write
	the code that tells your computer how to show you what the web designer
	wants you to see.</p>
	
	<p class="inputrequest">What do you think? Did I explain this well, or just
	confuse you further? What would you like to add? What questions does this
	article spark? Please post a comment below. If you leave your email
	address, it will be hidden from everyone but me, will never be given to
	anyone else, and will only be used to directly respond to you.</p>
