	<h2>10 Questions I Like to Ask During An Interview</h2>
		<p class="intro">
		When I first began my professional career, I decided to be a contractor 
		and so I went on a lot of interviews. 
		I always hated when we'd get to the end of the interview, and the 
		interviewer would ask, "Do you have any questions for me?" and I had 
		nothing to ask. I generally felt that the interviewer had done a good 
		job describing the company, and that the job description had described 
		the job. The questions asked during the interview would give me a good 
		idea of what work I would do. Because I didn't plan to be anywhere 
		for very long, it didn't seem like anything else was very important.
		</p>
		<p class="intro">
		But then I wound up in one contract with 
		about twenty developers in the room. I was the only contractor, and I 
		was the only one working on the project I was assigned. Everyone sat in 
		their cubicles and worked very quietly. This was the job where I bought 
		my first pair of headphones, not because I didn't want to be bothered, 
		but because the silence was driving me crazy. The other developers 
		would suddenly stand up and leave for lunch, and no one would speak to me. 
		I didn't even know where the break room was for the first four days. 
		Though the project was interesting, I was not very happy in that 
		environment. So I learned to ask a few questions to get a better feel for 
		what I would be doing and how I would be doing it.
		</p>
		<p class="intro">
		I have slowly built up a list of questions to ask in interviews that help 
		me to decide if I am a good fit for the position. I don't ask all these 
		questions in every interview, and these aren't all the questions I ask 
		during an interview. My default questions have changed, too, as I am 
		now looking for longer term contracts, or for a full-time employee status.

	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		Are you hiring to fill the needs of a specific project, or to fill a
		more general need?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		This question allows me to get a feel for the need, and the possibility
		of continuing work with this company. Also, it gives me a feel for how
		the company does business. If they are hiring for a specific project,
		then chances are good that they do work on a few projects at a time. If
		they are hiring to fill a general need, then generally, they are
		growing quickly and want to catch up on work or be a step ahead of the
		work. Either is a great situation for me!
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		If I asked the room if anyone wanted to hit Arby's with me for lunch,
		would I get any takers?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I used to ask, "What does your team do for lunch?", but a lot of the
		time, I got a blank look on this one. Other times, the interviewer
		would say something like, "Well, I usually go out with other managers,
		and the team will sometimes bring their lunch, and some go out..."
		before he trailed off and looked confused. I ask the question so
		that I can get a good idea of the dynamic of the team. If
		everyone has a set plan for lunch, and they don't like to deviate, it
		could spell trouble for the suitability and longevity of the position.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		I see such and such technologies listed on the job description. Can you
		tell me about any extra technologies that I would be working with, or
		may work with in the future?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		One of my goals in asking this question is to get a feel for the work
		I'll be doing. The world of web development changes quickly. If the
		interviewer can't think of any additional technologies I'll be working
		with, he may not have a good feel for IT in general. Or, he is hiring
		for a specific need, and needs a very focused developer. I can be that 
		focused developer, but I like to know going in. Another reason
		that I ask this question is to give me a chance to highlight skills I
		may have that the job description did not mention.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		What can you tell me about the work environment?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I keep this one purposely vague. I like to see what the interviewer
		thinks is the most important information here. Does he describe the
		technological environment - Windows vs. Linux, MS-SQL vs. Oracle, etc.?
		Or does he describe the physical environment -- warm vs. cold, cubicles,
		pool table? Or does he describe the people in the room -- friendly and
		loud, focused and quiet? If the interviewer looks confused or asks for
		clarification, I will ask him to either describe the technological
		environment or the people in the room -- which I ask depends on how
		well I understood the answers to the questions about lunch and
		extra technologies.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		What opportunities are there for personal development?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I've been surprised how many interviewers stumble over the answer to
		this question. Actually, only one company has answered this question
		without further prompting (which shows that I may need to find a way
		to rephrase the question). Many answer with opportunities more suited
		to answer the question "What opportunities are there for professional
		development?" Personal development is important to me, especially when
		I am considering a contract-to-hire or a permanent
		position. I really want to find a company that is as willing to invest
		in me as I am in them. I will spend a significant portion of my life
		at work, talking about work, thinking about work, and with people from
		work. I would like that time to be well-spent, and to contribute to
		my personal life as well as my professional. So, for example, I would
		consider attending a Scrapbooking conference personal development. It probably
		won't add significantly to my work ability, but it will make me a
		happier person if I can go mingle with other creative people, make
		new contacts, and maybe learn a few design tips or tricks that would help make
		my work easier. One company I contracted with offered a flexible 
		schedule, and one employee used this to take flight classes.

	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		Will you please tell me about the daily routine for this position?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I'm not looking for an agenda so much as a general idea of the routine.
		With whom do I check in, and how often? How long is the lunch break?
		What are the core hours of the position? When does the day kind of wrap
		up? I really love to hear, "That depends on the employee. As long as the 
		work gets done, we tend to set our own routines." This is an excellent
		sign that the company values employees as more than just man-hours and
		ROI dollars.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		If there is one technology you would like me to work on between now
		and my start date, what would it be?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		I really love asking this question. I love it best when the interviewer
		is able to answer with a technology that is not necessarily integral to
		the position, but that will certainly lessen the learning curve. The
		goal in asking this question is to show the interviewer that I want to
		take something away from the interview. Also, I want to portray that
		I'm interested in the position and that I'm eager to get started. I
		also like that it gives me one more chance to illustrate my biggest
		strength: self-directed learning.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		In six months, how will you know that you hired the right person?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		This is a really cool question, because it's basically asking for
		performance review criteria. I love knowing up front whether I'm going
		to be able to meet their criteria. Also, if I do get the position,
		there is a lot less guesswork as I try to meet expectations. It also
		shows the interviewer that I am looking forward to my time with the
		company, not just how I fit in today, but how I might fit in in the
		future.
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		Is there anything you see in the other candidates that you wish you saw
		in me?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		This question is a way of asking for feedback during the interview, 
		without asking if I got the job. The answer will tell me how well I 
		stack up against the competition. It will help me to compare my skills 
		to the job description, and to see if there was something else the 
		company is looking for that was more important than it seemed. Some 
		interviewers are really candid with their answers. "One candidate 
		is a great web developer with some graphic design ability, and that 
		could be useful." This also gives me a chance to highlight any skills 
		we didn't discuss yet, but might have been discussed with other 
		candidates. In this case, I would say, "I have a lot of experience 
		cutting apart PSD files, and am great at creating sprites."
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="questionandanswer">
		<p class="question">
		What do you like best about your job? Is there anything that you 
		have changed since you took your position?
		</p>
		<p class="answer">
		This one gives the interviewer a chance to brag on the company and 
		to brag on himself a bit. I want to hear if he slipped right in and 
		felt at home right away, or if he had to adjust first. I like to 
		hear that he didn't like something, and lobbied to make a change. It 
		gives me a good idea of how upper management views the IT department 
		and the needs of its workers. And after all the technical conversation, 
		it's nice to end on something a bit more personal.
		</p>
	</div>	
	<p class="wrapup">
	Obviously, asking these questions doesn't get me every job I try for. 
	But I have been much happier in the contracts I've chosen since I started 
	asking questions of the interviewer.
